Your task is to convert text enclosed between triple hyphens (---) into one or more Markdown documents that strictly adhere to the following structure:\n\n1. Document Title: The output document must start with a title line in the format # <TITLE>. Extract the title from the input (using the field title:).\n\n2. Key Concepts: Immediately following the title, include a section ## Key Concepts that lists all the main topics as bullet points. Identify these key concepts from the input content.\n\n3. Detailed Description: Next, provide a section titled ## Detailed Description where you elaborate on the key topics. Organize the narrative using Obsidian-compatible Markdown formatting—use additional headers, bullet or numbered lists, code blocks, callouts (use sparingly), and tables as needed. If the input includes a reference URL (from a field like reference:), include it at the beginning of this section as **Reference:** [URL](URL).\n- Ensure that the text is semantically segmented into logical, self-contained sections to enhance retrievability.\n- Reformat content into structured Markdown to improve machine readability and indexing.\n- Extract and explicitly label key metadata fields, ensuring they are easy to parse and utilize in retrieval.\n- Simplify complex ideas into clear, concise explanations while preserving the meaning of the original text.\n\n4. Summary: Follow up with a section ## Summary that concisely encapsulates the overall message of the input text in a few sentences. This section should ensure clarity and quick reference for retrieval purposes.\n\n5. Tags: Conclude the document with a section that starts with # Tags. List all relevant tags prefixed by # and separated by spaces. Tags should be optimized for search and retrieval.\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n- The input text will be provided between triple hyphens (---). It may include fields such as reference: and title:. Parse these fields and integrate their content appropriately.\n- Your output must STRICTLY follow the order and headings outlined above. Do not add any extra commentary or text outside these sections.\n- Ensure that the Markdown output is clear, organized, and compatible with Obsidian.\n- The output should enhance the retrievability of information by structuring it logically, removing redundancy, and highlighting key concepts effectively.\n- If the input text discusses multiple distinct topics, you may create multiple output documents. Each document should be enclosed within triple square brackets ([[[ ]]]) to clearly separate them. Use logical splitting criteria, such as distinct subject matter or topic segmentation, to ensure that each document remains cohesive and self-contained.\n\nBy following these instructions exactly, your transformed output will be predictable, structured, and useful for both users and RAG-based retrieval systems."

Potential actions that can be taken in a filter include sending messages to monitoring platforms (such as Langfuse or DataDog), modifying message contents, blocking toxic messages, translating messages to another language, or rate limiting messages from certain users. A list of examples is maintained in the Pipelines repo. Filters can be executed as a Function or on a Pipelines server. The general workflow can be seen in the image below.\n\n[Image: Filter Workflow]\n\nWhen a filter pipeline is enabled on a model or pipe, the incoming message from the user (or \"inlet\") is passed to the filter for processing. The filter performs the desired action against the message before requesting the chat completion from the LLM model. Finally, the filter performs post-processing on the outgoing LLM message (or \"outlet\") before it is sent to the user.\n---"

Filters are essential components used to perform specific actions on both incoming user messages and outgoing assistant (LLM) messages.\n\n### Functionality\nFilters can execute a range of actions, including:\n- **Monitoring:** Sending messages to platforms like Langfuse or DataDog.\n- **Modification:** Altering message content.\n- **Blocking:** Preventing toxic messages.\n- **Translation:** Converting messages to other languages.\n- **Rate Limiting:** Restricting message frequency from certain users.\n\n### Workflow\nThe filter workflow is divided into three main stages:\n1. **Inlet Processing:**\n   - Incoming user messages are passed to the filter.\n   - Filters perform the desired pre-processing actions.\n2. **LLM Processing:**\n   - After filtering, the chat completion request is sent to the LLM model.\n3. **Outlet Processing:**\n   - Outgoing LLM messages undergo post-processing by the filter before reaching the user.\n\n> **Note:** Filters can be executed either as a Function or on a Pipelines server, providing flexibility in deployment and execution.\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe workflow is often illustrated with a diagram labeled as *[Image: Filter Workflow]* to help users visualize the process from message intake (inlet) to message delivery (outlet).\n\n## Summary\nFilters within Pipelines are used to manage and manipulate message flows between users and LLM models. They provide critical functionalities such as monitoring, modifying, and securing communication, ensuring that messages are processed efficiently and safely throughout the pipeline.\n\n# Tags\n#filters #pipelines #LLM #messaging #workflow]]]"
